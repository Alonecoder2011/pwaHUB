# Kids here from the story
This is not ready, but i decieded to put a proof of concept out!
# What can i do currently?
Enter a url in the thingy and hit search, the teachers cannot see pwaHub (Some websites wont work (alot) because some hackers abuse iframes to preform clickjacking attempts!)
# I need help?
Create a issue (you need a github acct) or contact me!
# How do i install when its ready
```
Update from the POC (v0.9) to v1.0.0 RC

How?
Wait for v1.0.0 RC to come out...
```
# Install v0.9 (The proof of concept)
```
extract build.zip
in the folder right click and select run in terminal or whatever it is!
Enter the following commands:
npm install http-server -g
http-server -o public/www/
END OF COMMANDS (DONT TYPE)
find your ip address (LOCAL NOT PUBLIC) (If one of you f****** send me your public ip, i will die!)
how do i tho?
ipconfig, look for ipv4, note the ip down!
how do i ipconfig?
type in ipconfig in cmd
how do i cmd?
in the search bar type cmd and hit enter!
now lets continue,
the output of http-server ......
should say somthing like:

running on 127.0.0.1:PORT

ignore the stuff before the :
note that down! that is the port!

on your chromebook login!
open chrome, in the url type http://(THE IP I TOLD YOU TO WRITE DOWN):(THE PORT I TOLD YOU TO WRITE DOWN)

Thats it, just hit the monitor with a arrow icon on the side of the url bar!
